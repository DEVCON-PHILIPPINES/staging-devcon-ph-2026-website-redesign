# DEVCON.PH 2026 Website Redesign: Product Requirements Document

**Status:** Live on GitHub Pages · **Current version:** v2.01 · Workflow: staging → production · **Owner:** DEVCON Philippines National Office (Communications)
**Source of truth:** this file. When the site, a brief, or a chat thread disagrees with this PRD, update this PRD first, then the site.

---

## 1. Overview

The DEVCON.PH 2026 website is the public home of DEVCON Philippines (DevConnect Philippines Inc.), the country's largest volunteer tech community: a non-profit founded in 2009 with 13 locations nationwide. The 2026 redesign launches with DEVCON 17 and its theme, **Engineering an AI-Ready Nation**.

The site is a static, self-contained HTML build. It is a visual and content blueprint for the eventual production site at devcon.ph, and it runs in two environments: **staging-** on GitHub Pages (https://devcon-philippines.github.io/staging-devcon-ph-2026-website-redesign/) and **prod-** on Cloudflare Pages (https://prod-devcon-ph-2026-website-redesign.pages.dev).

## 2. Goals

1. **Grow participation:** make it easy to find a free event, volunteer, join a chapter, or apply to a program.
2. **Win partners:** show verifiable outcomes through DevRel case studies so companies, schools, and LGUs partner with confidence.
3. **Build trust:** present DEVCON as a registered, accountable non-profit with clear standards (Community Playbook, policies, leadership).
4. **Collect feedback:** gather feedback on the redesign during review through the Give Feedback tab and Devie.
5. **Be discoverable:** rank in search and AI answers (SEO and AEO) for DEVCON, Philippine tech community, and AI education topics.

### Non-goals

- No user accounts, logins, payments, or stored personal data on this site. Registration lives on DEVCON+ (https://www.devcon.plus) and partner forms.
- No costs, budgets, or financial figures in public content (for example, case studies never mention costs).

## 4. Information architecture

**Top menu:** Our Story, Programs, Locations, DevRel Case Studies, Community Playbook, Volunteer.

**AI Fluency & Agentic Training** (`/programs/ai-fluency-agentic-training/`) is one program everywhere: the AI Fluency Masterclass, a hands-on Agentic AI Hackathon, and Agentic Training for Leaders (chapter leaders) sit inside it. It appears once on Programs, in the menu, in the anniversary pillars, and in the DEVCON 17 manifesto. Event names such as "NEXUS AI Fluency Masterclass and Hackathon" keep their official titles. Older masterclass and agentic-training addresses redirect here.

**Invite** covers kids and youth: an Elementary and high schools card (DEVCON Kids, Hour of AI, micro:bit, robotics, teacher training), DepEd divisions under local governments, and the invitation email asks for the audience (kids and youth, students, or professionals).

**#SHEISDEVCON** (`/programs/sheisdevcon/`) carries photos and videos from devcon.ph/she-2026: featured "Why the Board of Investments supports #SHEISDEVCON" (muted autoplay), a 2025 highlights section (collage + 3 photos), and "Stories from the community" (BOI message, Jumpstart intern story, two awareness shorts; no autoplay).

**Hour of AI 2026 season** appears on the Hour of AI case study ("The season at a glance") and the DEVCON Kids page ("Milestones: Hour of AI 2026"): execution windows Nov 23–26 and Dec 7–18, 2026; free teacher and volunteer training Nov 14, 21, 28; a four-phase timeline (school contacting, preparation and training, execution, post event) through the Hour of AI and Chapter Awards Night on Feb 5, 2027; CTAs Volunteer for Hour of AI and Book a date for your school. The 2026 season keeps its 2026 name.

**Location videos:** every location page has one YouTube video after its 2025 impact report row: a DEVCON channel video that names the chapter where one exists (Manila, Laguna, Pampanga, Iloilo, Bacolod, Davao, Iligan, Bukidnon), otherwise the chapter-leader video qg52LcKPUHc ("Know a city that needs DEVCON?" on active chapters, "Help grow DEVCON in <place>" on volunteer communities). Outdated event invitations and videos that conflict with a page (for example, a president intro for a community without active officers) are not used.

**Programs menu:** DEVCON Kids is listed first under Pioneering programs.

**Homepage first view:** the hero is sized to the screen height so the "Trusted by leaders and pioneers" logo carousel is visible on first load, from 1920×1080 desktops to 375×667 phones (the hero illustration is hidden on phones).

**Homepage hero CTAs:** "Attend free events" (scrolls to the DEVCON+ banner) and "Discover a chapter near you" (opens the Locations map).

**Homepage order:** hero, logo carousel ("Trusted by leaders and pioneers"), locations map (static on mobile), numbers, about, 17 years, explore, Recent news 3×3 ("What we've been building", led by the Mindanao AI Caravan as major news), Be part of DEVCON 17 hub, FAQ, partners, DEVCON+ banner.

**Pages (51):**

- **Core:** Home (`/`), About DEVCON Philippines (`about`, org history and "a community, not an events company"), DEVCON 17 manifesto (`17years`, Engineering an AI-Ready Nation and the 17-year anniversary), Leadership (`leadership`), Programs (`programs`), Attend (`attend`), Partner (`partner`), Invite DEVCON (`invite`), AI Scholarships (`ai`), Jumpstart Internships (`jumpstart-internships`), AI code camps (`ai-code-camps`).
- **Locations:** Locations hub (`chapters`) and 13 location pages: manila, laguna, legazpi, pampanga, cebu, iloilo, bohol, bacolod, tacloban, davao, iligan, cagayandeoro, bukidnon.
- **Programs:** devcon-kids, campus, sheisdevcon, pro-summit, crest, dctx, educators, ai-fluency-masterclass.
- **DevRel case studies:** hub (`devrel-case-studies`) and case-study-sui, case-study-icp, case-study-hour-of-ai, case-study-zoho-creator, case-study-campus-devcon-summit, case-study-pro-summit, case-study-mindanao-ai-caravan, case-study-ai-physical-computing-educators.
- **Community Playbook:** playbook, volunteers-guide, code-of-conduct-for-national-and-chapter-officers-and-volunteers, standard-privacy-and-safespace-consent, campus-events-guidelines, child-protection-policy, brand-kit.

**URLs use section folders.** Pages live under their section: `/about/` (with `/about/17years/`, `/about/leadership/`), `/programs/<program>/` (for example `/programs/kids/`, `/programs/campus/`, `/programs/ai-scholarships/`), `/locations/<city>/` (for example `/locations/manila/`), `/case-studies/<name>/` (for example `/case-studies/sui/`), `/playbook/<page>/` (Brand Kit, policies, volunteers guide), plus `/attend/`, `/invite/`, `/partner/`. The folder map lives in `scripts/paths.py` and drives the deploy layout, links, canonical URLs, the sitemap, Devie's links, and all redirects. Every older address (flat `/cebu/`, `/devcon-kids/`, `/case-study-sui/`, `.html` links, and the old devcon.ph URLs) 301-redirects to its folder page; unknown paths inside a section go to that section's page. The downloadable ZIP keeps `.html` file names so pages open locally.

**Legacy URL migration.** Every known devcon.ph URL either maps to a page with the same path or redirects to its new home. `docs/url-map.json` lists all pages and redirects. Highlights:

| Old URL | New page |
|---|---|
| `/she-2026/` | `/sheisdevcon/` |
| `/campussummit2023/` | `/case-study-campus-devcon-summit/` |
| `/prosummit2023/` | `/case-study-pro-summit/` |
| `/summergiveaway2023/` | `/case-study-zoho-creator/` |
| `/ai-fluency/` | `/ai-fluency-masterclass/` |
| `/events/` | `/attend/` |
| Sui "Build Beyond" news post | `/case-study-sui/` |
| ISLA CAMP / ICP 2025 news post | `/case-study-icp/` |
| AI Engineering Scholarship 2025 news post | `/ai/` |
| Climate Bayanihan workshop 2025 post | `/programs/` |
| `/feed/`, `/comments/feed/`, `/author/devconadmin/`, `/news/`, `/blog/` | `/` |
| `/<page>.html` links from earlier previews | `/<page>/` |

Common aliases also redirect (for example `/sponsors/`, `/partners/`, `/contact/` → `/partner/`; `/case-studies/` → `/devrel-case-studies/`; `/cdo/` → `/cagayandeoro/`). Anything else hits a smart `404.html`, which matches the old path by slug or keyword (chapter names, programs, news topics) and forwards to the closest page. If nothing matches, it shows links to Home, Locations, Programs, Events, and Partner, never a dead end. On Cloudflare Pages, `docs/_redirects` turns these into server-side 301s, so search engines transfer rankings. When a new old URL is reported, add it to `REDIRECTS` in `scripts/restructure.py`.

## 5. Content rules (style guide)

These rules are enforced by review and, where possible, by `scripts/check_site.py`.

- **Locations:** say "13 locations", never "13 chapters". The map header reads "13 grassroots locations nationwide". Strategic growth areas (Ilocos Region, MIMAROPA with the pin in Palawan, Zamboanga, GenSan) appear on the homepage and Locations maps as dashed cyan circles that animate in last. They have no local partners or applications yet, are not part of the 13, and are not in any menu or list. Nine are active chapters; Bohol, Bacolod, Tacloban, and Cagayan de Oro are volunteer communities.
- **Chapter status:** volunteer communities have no active or renewed chapter officers. Promotion to active chapter status follows a stringent process that tests commitment, readiness, and long-term alignment with DEVCON as a non-profit, beyond seed funds and tech hype. Volunteer-community pages use Volunteer CTAs.
- **Who we are:** DEVCON is a volunteer tech community, not an events company. Speakers, mentors, officers, and organizers volunteer to pay it forward and give back to the community, and every program is a public good. Homepage, Locations, every chapter page, Leadership, and Invite carry this message.
- **Location page flow.** Active chapters (8 rows): Hero (president; Volunteer today / Join DEVCON+) → About <place> (photo + Did you know?) → 2025 impact report (story and unique tech topics on the left; a centered Notable events card on the right, up to 6 events; snapshots below; no separate highlights list) → By the numbers (stats, awards, testimony) → What's next (be the first to know + Get involved; Volunteer today / Join DEVCON+ / Follow) → Where we meet + Quality over quantity → Visiting + Keep exploring → closing CTA. Volunteer communities keep a concise hero (one "No active events right now" chip, Help restart / Find events nearby, a short "On the path to a full chapter" note linking to Quality over quantity) and show nearby active chapters inside Upcoming events. Rows alternate backgrounds around the numbers row.
- **Volunteer communities (Bohol, Bacolod, Tacloban, Cagayan de Oro):** say plainly there are **no active events right now** (hero status note, "No active events in <city> yet" in Upcoming events, "Past highlights" for earlier activity). CTAs: Help restart DEVCON <city> / Volunteer to help restart, Get updates on DEVCON+, and Find events nearby, which jumps to a list of active chapters in the same region only.
- **Forward-looking CTAs and goals use 2027** (for example "Level up #SHEISDEVCON in 2027", "10,000 youth in 2027", "Hour of AI 2027"). The 2026 anniversary theme, DEVCON 17, chapter terms (2026–2027), event dates, and 2026 results stay as they are.
- **2025 data:** always labeled as the **2025 impact report**.
- **Chapter pages:** active chapters lead with **Volunteer today** (volunteer form popup) and **Join DEVCON+** ("Join DEVCON+ to start earning points and redeeming rewards like merch"). Each page has a 2 to 3 sentence chapter president profile drawn from verified chapter data, a "Did you know?" with local economic context tech can help transform, a first-time visitor guide ("First time in <place>? Must-visit spots", 4 destinations) with the active officer host perk, and the volunteer-led line near the end.
- **Chapter capacity:** as a volunteer community, DEVCON has limited capacity. To date, 4 chapters were not renewed for non-compliance and inactivity. DEVCON always prioritizes quality over quantity, of both events and impact. Requirements are listed on the Invite page (`/invite/#chapter-requirements`).
- **How chapters start:** every chapter starts with a DEVCON speaker paying it forward at a free event. Hosts cover each volunteer speaker's transportation, meals, a token of appreciation, and accommodations (as applicable); this is required outside existing chapter locations. Invitations go to hello@devcon.ph using the pre-filled invitation email on the Invite page.
- **Office:** "DEVCON HQ Office at Makati or Ortigas".
- **Programs and names:** "AI Fluency for Builders"; "Beyond the capital" (chapter presidents section); mention AI Certification Scholarships; AI tools are "OpenCode, Anthropic Claude, Ollama, and more".
- **AI Scholarships:** scholarships and exam attempts are granted on an approval basis and are not guaranteed.
- **Internships:** Jumpstart runs five months, voluntary or as an academic requirement. Applications go through the Airtable form.
- **Partners:** "They make our programs free, possible, and life-changing for grassroots communities." Credit Amihan and Avtica (never NMBLR). Sui verified figure is "330+".
- **Exclusions:** no mention of Michael Lance Domagas. No dates on chapter event lists. No costs in public content.
- **Links:** no links out to the old devcon.ph site; every page lives in this repo. When a destination is unknown, link to https://www.facebook.com/devconph (the build replaces any empty link with it).
- **Changelog:** notes stay generic, with no sponsor, partner, or people names.
- **Voice:** clear, declarative, grounded. No hedging or reported speech in content adapted from keynotes.

## 6. Features

### 6.1 Volunteer popup
Every Volunteer CTA opens a centered popup with the DEVCON volunteer Google Form (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczVxZPmHIRPphNJNgbuRVzEC5QTponVzjDPPMmkSxP0cIdrg/viewform). The form URL is the no-JavaScript fallback. The popup closes with Esc, the close button, or a click outside, and offers "Open in new tab".

### 6.2 Feedback
Feedback is collected through Devie (6.3). The right-edge Give Feedback tab was removed in v1.72. Feedback emails go to:

- **To:** jumpstart-interns-c5-2026@devcon.ph, rj@devcon.ph, acapucion@devcon.ph, ddeleon@devcon.ph, jfernando@devcon.ph
- **Subject:** DEVCON.PH 2026 Website Redesign Feedback and Screenshots
- **Body:** the visitor's feedback, page, link, version, screen, browser, and a reminder to attach screenshots.

### 6.3 Devie, DEVCON AI Assistant
A rule-based chat at the lower right of every page. Devie is a **basic FAQ bot, not an AI or LLM**: it matches keywords to set answers written by the DEVCON team and runs entirely in the browser, with no AI model, no API, and no data collected. The header, welcome message, footer note, and an "are you AI?" answer all say so. The panel is up to 420 × 720 px (full width on phones) with 16 px message text, sized so the welcome fits without scrolling.

- **Primary job is feedback:** the welcome asks for feedback, a Submit feedback button sits above the input, and every answer ends with a feedback prompt. Feedback mode turns the visitor's words into the feedback email in 6.2.
- **Motion:** the panel pops in, messages slide in, and a typing indicator shows before each reply (about 0.7 to 1.6 seconds, longer for longer questions). Reduced-motion users get instant replies with no animation.
- **Local welcome:** the greeting matches the chapter page (Tagalog, Bisaya, Hiligaynon, Bikol, Kapampangan, or Waray) and is random elsewhere.
- **Fallback:** unknown questions get "Oops, I'm not yet trained for that question!" plus suggestions.
- **FAQ answers:** basic questions in English, Filipino, and regional words, with a Gen Z tone. Every answer links to the right page or section.

### 6.4 Other features
- **Locations map:** homepage map with pulsing chapter dots, where rows and pins link to chapter pages. Each location page has a Philippines mini-map, an OpenStreetMap view framed on the chapter's whole administrative region (for example, Central Visayas for Cebu and Bohol), and an Open in Google Maps link. There is no Get directions button.
- **FAQ next steps:** every FAQ answer ends with "Next step" links.
- **Leaders:** a full-width Founder and President row for Winston Damarillo (bio and why DEVCON matters to him), then the board, national office, area program leaders, and chapter presidents, each with a LinkedIn link. Chapter president photos use a standardized head-and-shoulders crop, tone-matched to a bright, clean studio look and sharpened at 360 px.
- **Intern quotes:** each name links to Jumpstart intern stories on Medium.
- **Scroll animations:** homepage headings and cards fade up with a light stagger; off for reduced-motion users.
- **Case studies:** every case study leads and closes with **Sponsor the next one** and **Help scale this program nationally**, ends with "Discover other case studies and impactful results", and shows program years where relevant (ICP 2024–2025 · 2 years; Sui 2026 · Year 1). Summit case study headlines carry no year.
- **DEVCON Kids (`/devcon-kids/`):** dedicated program page from the 2026 DEVCON Kids deck and 2026 inputs: 2025 impact report (5,609 students, 184 volunteers, 70 schools, 44 code camps), why it matters (PISA 2022, TIMSS 2019), programs, 2026 momentum and event log (15 events, 990+ learners and educators, January to August), 2025 reach by chapter, chapter launches, real stories (86/78/92%), featured video, 2026 initiatives, an "In action" photo section from Hour of AI and educator sessions, and coming up (DEVCON Kids Hour of AI). Case studies: DEVCON for Educators with CSTA and DEVCON Kids (`/case-study-devcon-for-educators/`), micro:bit (`/case-study-microbit/`), and Hour of AI with a 2025 to 2026 section.
- **Video:** the NEXUS final-stop video (YouTube, privacy-enhanced embed, muted autoplay, centered) on the Mindanao AI Caravan case study; "DEVCON at 16: Inspiring the Next Generation with DEVCON Kids" (SdVjWd_4MUE) on the DEVCON Kids page, and "Why Sui partnered with DEVCON Philippines" (JDe6L8peLvk) on the Sui case study; CSP allows only youtube-nocookie.com and youtube.com frames.
- **Section rhythm:** location pages alternate section backgrounds; related pairs (events + snapshots, stats + awards, quality over quantity + volunteer-led line) share a band; 72 px desktop / 48 px mobile spacing.
- **Brand Kit:** logos, palette, Montserrat, key visuals, boilerplate, and entity information.

## 7. Design system

- **Colors:** navy #070430, deep navy #05022A, yellow #F2C500, purple #7808FF, lavender #A57BFF, orange #EA641D, green #71B405, pink #EC4899. Region colors: Luzon purple, Visayas orange, Mindanao green.
- **Type:** Montserrat (900/800 headlines, 700/600 labels, 400 body).
- **Accessibility:** WCAG-minded contrast, 44 px minimum tap targets, visible focus states, skip link, semantic landmarks, reduced-motion support, alt text on every meaningful image.
- **Responsive:** verified at 1440, 820, and 375 px with no horizontal scroll.

## 8. Technical architecture

- **Self-contained pages:** each page is one HTML file with inlined CSS, JavaScript, and images (base64). This prevents broken rendering when files are opened individually.
- **Build:** a single-page build is split into per-page files, stamped with version and PHT time (filename, header change-log comment, and meta tags; never the visible footer), then hardened.
- **Repo layout:** `docs/` is the deployed site (`docs/<slug>/index.html` per page, redirect stubs, `404.html`, `url-map.json`); `combined/` holds the single-file version; `scripts/restructure.py` builds the deploy layout and redirects; `scripts/harden.py` pins the CSP; `scripts/check_site.py` runs the checks, including that every redirect lands on a real page.
- **SEO and AEO:** per-page titles and descriptions, canonical URLs for devcon.ph, Open Graph and X cards, JSON-LD (NGO, Organization, Breadcrumb, Article, FAQPage), sitemap.xml, AI-friendly robots.txt, and llms.txt.

## 9. Security

The site is static, has no backend, and stores no personal data. Hardening:

| Threat | Control |
|---|---|
| XSS and unauthorized scripts | Strict Content-Security-Policy on every page: `default-src 'none'`, scripts limited to `'self'` plus SHA-256 hashes of each inline script (no `unsafe-inline`, no `unsafe-eval`), `object-src 'none'`, `base-uri 'none'`, `form-action 'none'`, frames limited to OpenStreetMap and Google Forms, and `upgrade-insecure-requests`. No inline event handlers, no `javascript:` URLs, no external script files. Devie writes visitor text with `textContent`, never as HTML. |
| Clickjacking | Pages hide themselves when loaded inside another site's frame. |
| Tabnabbing and referrer leaks | Every new-tab link has `rel="noopener"`; referrer policy is `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`. |
| DDoS and traffic spikes | Served from Cloudflare Pages (project `devcon-ph-2026-website-redesign`, output `docs/`, branch `main`) on Cloudflare's global network with built-in DDoS protection; GitHub Pages remains a mirror. When devcon.ph is connected, enable Bot Fight Mode, WAF managed rules, and rate limiting on the zone. |
| Missing HTTP security headers | `docs/_headers` (Cloudflare Pages) sends HSTS, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, `nosniff`, referrer policy, Permissions-Policy, and COOP; `*.pages.dev` is `noindex` so only devcon.ph is indexed. |
| Supply chain and secrets | Secret scanning and push protection, Dependabot updates, CodeQL code scanning, and read-only workflow permissions by default. |
| Unauthorized changes | Protected `main` (pull request, code-owner approval, passing checks, no force pushes) and deploy approval for the `github-pages` environment. |

`scripts/check_site.py` fails any pull request that breaks these rules. Report vulnerabilities through GitHub private vulnerability reporting or hello@devcon.ph (see `SECURITY.md` and `/.well-known/security.txt`).

## 10. Workflow and governance

**Environment labels:** GitHub Pages is **staging-**, Cloudflare Pages is **prod-**. Old addresses redirect with no 404s: the previous GitHub Pages path is forwarded by the `devcon-philippines.github.io` redirect repo to staging (same path), and the previous `devcon-ph-2026-website-redesign.pages.dev` project 301-redirects to prod- (its old staging alias goes to staging-). Keep both redirect sources in place.

The site is open source and welcomes outside contributors; **approval is centralized to HQ leaders** (`@domdeleondevcon`, `@JFernando-DEVCON`, later the `hq-leaders` team).

**Branches and environments**

| Branch | Environment | Deploys to | Protection |
|---|---|---|---|
| `feature/*`, `content/*`, `fix/*`, `docs/*`, `chore/*` | PR preview | Cloudflare preview URL per pull request | None; short-lived, deleted after merge |
| `staging` (default) | staging- (GitHub Pages) | https://devcon-philippines.github.io/staging-devcon-ph-2026-website-redesign/ (noindex) | PR required, 1 code-owner (HQ) approval, last-push approval, conversations resolved, site-checks and CodeQL required, squash only, no bypass, no force push or deletion |
| `main` | prod- (Cloudflare Pages) | https://prod-devcon-ph-2026-website-redesign.pages.dev | Same as staging, plus the release-source check (PRs from `staging` or `hotfix/*` only), merge commits only, and an HQ-approved `github-pages` environment (no admin bypass, no self-review) |

**Flow**

1. Branch from `staging` (or fork) and open a PR into `staging`.
2. Checks run and Cloudflare posts a preview link; an HQ leader approves and squash-merges.
3. `staging` auto-deploys to the staging URL.
4. An HQ leader opens a release PR from `staging` into `main`; another HQ leader approves it; merge with a merge commit.
5. **Deploy production (Cloudflare Pages)** waits for HQ approval in the `production` environment, deploys to prod-, and verifies every page. Staging deploys to GitHub Pages automatically on each merge into `staging`. Cloudflare's own Git production deploys are off.
6. Hotfixes: `hotfix/*` from `main` into `main`, then back-merge `main` into `staging`.

**Other controls:** outside-contributor workflow runs need approval, only GitHub-owned actions are allowed, workflow tokens are read-only, Cloudflare credentials are environment secrets (production and staging) that only approved deploy jobs can read, and Dependabot targets `staging`. Every release bumps the minor version and updates `CHANGELOG.md`.

## 11. Acceptance criteria for any release

- All pages return 200, with no console errors or CSP violations.
- No horizontal scroll at 1440, 820, and 375 px, and every interactive element is at least 44 px.
- `scripts/check_site.py` passes.
- The content rules in section 5 hold.
- The version and PHT timestamp are updated in the filename, header comment, and meta tags.

## 12. Open items

- **LinkedIn URLs:** replace the LinkedIn people-search links on the Leadership page with each leader's exact profile URL.
- **Custom domain:** connect devcon.ph, put it behind Cloudflare, then submit the sitemap to Google Search Console and Bing.
- **Content gaps:** real headshot for the Winston Damarillo placeholder, better Tacloban and Manila photos, and actual Mindanao AI Caravan attendance to replace targets.
- **AI Scholarships:** move the application from email to a form.
- **Legazpi award:** confirm the official name.

## 13. Contacts

- **Website team:** jumpstart-interns-c5-2026@devcon.ph, rj@devcon.ph, acapucion@devcon.ph, ddeleon@devcon.ph, jfernando@devcon.ph
- **General and partnerships:** hello@devcon.ph
