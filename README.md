# DEVCON.ph 2026 Website Redesign

The rebuilt **devcon.ph** for DEVCON 17: *Engineering an AI-Ready Nation*. It is written to replace the current devcon.ph content, so every page lives here and nothing links back to the old site.

**Current version:** v2.01 · Oct 2, 2026, 7:56 PM PHT (see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md))

## What's in this repo

| Folder | What it is |
|---|---|
| `docs/` | The website: 51 self-contained HTML pages, plus `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, and the social share image. Every image, style, and script is inlined, so any page opens on its own. |
| `combined/` | The same site as one HTML file, for quick review. |

Page file names follow the devcon.ph URL format, so `docs/manila.html` maps to `devcon.ph/manila/`. The compliance pages keep their exact devcon.ph slugs.

## Pages

- **Home and about:** `index.html`, `about.html` (Our Story), `leadership.html`
- **Programs:** `programs.html`, `devcon-kids.html`, `campus.html`, `sheisdevcon.html`, `pro-summit.html`, `crest.html`, `dctx.html`, `educators.html`

## Preview locally

Open `docs/index.html` in a browser. The pages link to each other by file name, so keep them in the same folder.

## Publish with GitHub Pages

Merges into `staging` deploy to **staging-** (GitHub Pages) automatically. Release merges into `main` deploy to **prod-** (Cloudflare Pages) after HQ approval.

To serve it on devcon.ph instead, add the domain under **Custom domain** on the same Settings page.

## Source of truth

[PRD.md](PRD.md) is the product requirements document and single source of truth for goals, pages, content rules, features, security, and workflow.

## Environments

- **staging-** (GitHub Pages, branch `staging`, noindex): https://devcon-philippines.github.io/staging-devcon-ph-2026-website-redesign/
- **prod-** (Cloudflare Pages, branch `main`): https://prod-devcon-ph-2026-website-redesign.pages.dev

Old addresses redirect automatically: the previous GitHub Pages URL goes to staging, and the previous Cloudflare URL goes to production.

Open pull requests against `staging`. HQ leaders review, merge, and release to `main`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Contributing and approvals

Changes go through a pull request, a review by a website admin, and an approved deploy. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

- **site-checks** runs on every pull request and checks links, SEO tags, structured data, and wording.
- `main` is protected: pull request required, one approval from a code owner, passing checks, no force pushes.
- Merges into `main` deploy to GitHub Pages after an admin approves the `github-pages` environment.
- Issues and pull requests are added to the [DEVCON 2026 Website Design](https://github.com/orgs/DEVCON-PHILIPPINES/projects/2) project board.

## SEO

Every page has its own title and description, a canonical `https://devcon.ph/<slug>/` URL, Open Graph and X share tags, and schema.org data. Key pages also have answer-first FAQ sections marked up for AI search, `robots.txt` explicitly allows search engines and AI assistants, and `llms.txt` gives AI tools a plain-text summary with links. After launch, submit `sitemap.xml` in Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools.

## Built for

The target CMS is Brizy on WordPress (www.devcon.ph). These pages serve as the visual and content blueprint.
